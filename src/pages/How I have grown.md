## In what ways are you a different person from a year ago? In what ways are you the same?

But *what* defines me as a person? I think: my virtues, my beliefs, my personality and lastly, my physical attributes (roughly in that order of significance). So I have tried to include things from all of these aspects.

### Different

* I've started taking more responsibilities and actually *being* more responsible.  
* I've started to track different life metrics like focus, energy, sleep and decisions.  
* My views on formal education have shifted from a "(in angry tone) *Ughh\!* *Why do we have to do it anyway?*" to more Stoic â€œ*Alright, given the circumstances I live in, maybe this is one of the few choices that I have. Maybe I shouldn't fight it and instead try to factor it* into *my way of living.*"  
* I've become more introspective. I try to use criticism and social cues as information to understand where my flaws lie and improve.  
* I've started to focus on *less* things at a time. Underworking helps me create better things.  
* I've much better *systems* now: SRS/Anki, habit stacks, learning systems, mental models, etc.  
* I've started to balance Theory and Practice as much as I can.   
* I'm trying to use rational methods like forecasting, probabilistic (Bayesian) thinking, etc. in daily life.  
* I understand my dependency and my relationship with my family a little better. I recognise the shift in the power dynamics as I age *with* them. I am embracing this shift.  
* I have a better understanding of *who I am* and *who I want to be* (a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday)  
* My tech usage habits have changed drastically. I have adopted a digitally minimal (cf. Cal Newport) approach to tech.

### Same

* My overall goal remains the same: to help people learn better and make better education systems.  
* My favourite subject is still Math. And I still love teaching\!  
* I am still indecisive at times and often go through analysis paralysis (I am working on this.)  
* I am almost at the same level in my guitar proficiency.  
* I still love learning new stuff. My aspiration to become a polymath hasn't budged.  
* I have almost the same physical stature; though I have improved my endurance and stamina a bit.  
* I still believe that autodidactism and unschooling are much better than formal ways of schooling (note: I am *not* unschooled; bias?).  
* I still believe that the Indian political system could use a significant revamp. Its current situation (which includes the government) is sort of Orwellian and quite a facade.
