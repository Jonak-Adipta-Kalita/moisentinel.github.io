## TL;DR

I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

My 11th Grade is officially over. I just got done with my final exams and it sure does feel great. But yeah, this academic year went SOOPER fast. I didn't have a moment to rest. It was boss fights after boss fights.

I am on a fallow period, to recharge myself and do some maintenance. I want to get started with some things before I start my my academic year:

- trip with best friends
- work on the RPG game I've been thinking about (updates coming soon!)
- streamline content posting workflow
- buy a used ThinkPad (pref. T14 G1 AMD)
- new [podcast](https://run.nibirsan.org/podcast) episodes (new season! and with guests!)
- finish the [math course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/)
- reach level 2 of philosophy curricula
- cope up with film backlogs
- workspace edits?

Also, I have been having some really fun time focusing and doing deep work while streaming on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nibirsankar). I think I will continue that throughout the year (as much I can; check forecast [here](https://fatebook.io/q/will-i-continue-study-with-me-streams--cm8ijkt6p0000hrgpad3s9qvh).) And I'd very much like if you'd join the sessions as well! 
I stream at 2pm IST; check schedule [here](run.nibirsan.org/stream-schedule).

**Some New and Old Habits:**
- Meditation Streak - 229 Days ðŸ”¥
- [Bodyweight exercises](https://old.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/fivvhv/the_quarantine_workout_template/) go brrr
- Reading almost everyday
- I love journaling!

Lately, I have been obsessed with Nietzsche, the idea of Love and listening to fiction podcasts.

## This year

My main themes for this year are:

- **Work**: Focusing on both formal education and self education
- **Health**: Creating better systems
	- via habits, ritualisation and tracking
- **Relationships**: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents
- **Personal Growth**: Seeking the virtuous life
	- imo "virtuous" = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)

Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.

## No but, who are you exactly?

The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. I mean, why *should* it happen?

I am someone who likes thinking *very* much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and deriving overcomplicated, mathematical solutions to day-to-day problems (like choosing which soap I should buy). Just Kidding! Although it does seem like that when I throw terms like "confirmation bias" or "statistical base-rate" around.

I think of myself as curious. I like doing a lot of things: learning new things, math, reading, philosophy, livestreaming, making music and videos, writing and the list goes on. **But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create *meaningful* stuff.**

I love my work ethic and the process of creation and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a *bit* workaholic and ambitious at times. 

My philosophy is inspired by:
- Stoicism
- Rationality
- Digital Minimalism
- Doing things that matter
- James Scholz (my idol)

I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself. I also love building better systems using Anki/SRS, Obsidian and other productivity tools/techniques. I am a memory and psychology enthusiast.

I value deep and genuine connections with people. I am very much interested in meeting new people.

So, **I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday**.
### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi and Sanskrit (a bit), in that order of proficiency. Published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about the *environment* in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. 

Attended NYAS Junior Academy Fall '24 and yada yada. More on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nibirsankar).

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am not a very *reachable* person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org) (preferred)
*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
