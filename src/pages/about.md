## TL;DR

I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, playing music, reading, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

Learning [fundamentals of AI Safety](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/home/alignment) as "extra reading" for [NYAS's Junior Academy](https://www.nyas.org/learning/high-school-research-programs/the-junior-academy/) 2024 Fall Cohort - "Ethical AI" Challenge, starting 23rd September. And as a consequence, I am learning a little [Linear Algebra](https://medium.com/sho-jp/towards-understanding-linear-algebra-part-1-d43710535503) and some Python as well. So far so good.

The second in priority is prepping for my unit test (starting 21st September), the first in this year, and I think it will be harder than all my previous exams. But that is all based on hearsay, so you can't really be sure. Although I trust my study system (Obsidian + Anki + eff. strats) to help me out on this one. 
Worst case scenario: I get to reflect on my mistakes.

Been maintaining a streak of meditating for 40 days straight (as of today), and a writing habit (wrote 6 [blogposts](/blog/archive/) and 3 [newsletters](https://run.nibirsan.org/substack/) In August; I'd say I am quite proud). 
But not making enough videos for the [series](https://run.nibirsan.org/explanatory), and it is something I have to work on...

well, stay frosty mates!

## This year

My main goals for this year are:

* Becoming a knowledge worker- consume, consolidate, create.
* Creating content- this blog, [newsletter](https://visionoflife.substack.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar) and [podcast](/pantheon/).
* Getting more fit- health = wealth.
* Spending more time with friends and family, and developing new connections
* Becoming more confident- spread out and face fears, carpe diem.

## No but, who are you exactly?

The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. But yes, I do have a certain personality, which is hard to describe on paper. I will try my best.

I am that guy who is fueled by curiosity. I often need a "challenge" and hence I always try to learn something new. I like the idea of helping people, even though they can be jerks at times (I am sorta aligned to Stoicism). I want to transcend beyond the norms, and do things that *actually matter.*

I love my work ethic and my process of creation. I tend to be workaholic sometimes, and love my work (apart from meaningless school stuff).

You can read about my beliefs [here](/beliefs/), although it is very, very incomplete.

Few of my blogs that display some of my personality:

*   [I am an addict](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict)- a poem I wrote in my native language
*   [why do I study?](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study)
*   [when you have metamorphosised](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised)

I also love working on productivity and cognition systems: Obsidian, Spaced Repetition, workflows, AI, etc. 
I can also help you reach out to people that knows things beyond my understanding (I have a few friends whom I count on, for their *expert* guidance).

### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi, Sanskrit (a bit); in that order of proficiency. An aspiring researcher; published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about environment in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I am eager to attend more programs/camps. And the goal here is to learn new things and skills that make me a better person and help me do great things for the world.

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am very particular about replying times. People close to me *know* that I am very hard to reach. 

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, and want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org)
