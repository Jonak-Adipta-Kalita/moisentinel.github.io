## TL;DR

I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, playing music, reading, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

September and October have been quite interesting. I mostly worked on learning about AI Safety/Research, getting my laptop fixed, exams (and recuperating from it), and making better habits. I also posted a few blogs and videos, and went halfway through the Oxford General Philosophy [Course](https://github.com/moiSentineL/oxford-general-philosophy-2009)

And, I will mainly focus on getting done with my half-yearly exams (a lot of credit is on stake), and improving my Financial Literacy and marketing skills; something that I have been wanting to do since a long time. I am also planning to do some hobby projects like making some app, improving my guitar skills and making a [podcast](https://run.nibirsan.org/podcast).

Meditation streak: 97 days, as of writing this. Made a habit of reading before bed and going through Anki after meals. Also committing myself to a Reading Day every month, where I read (and finish) a book all day.

Lately, I have been obsessed with coffee, pencils and music for no reason.

## This year

My main goals for this year are:

* Becoming a knowledge worker- consume, consolidate, create.
* Creating content- this blog, [newsletter](https://visionoflife.substack.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar) and [podcast](/pantheon/).
* Getting more fit- health = wealth.
* Spending more time with friends and family, and developing new connections
* Becoming more confident- spread out and face fears, carpe diem.

## No but, who are you exactly?

The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. But yes, I do have a certain personality, which is hard to describe on paper. I will try my best.

I am that guy who is fueled by curiosity. I often need a "challenge" and hence I always try to learn something new. I like the idea of helping people, even though they can be jerks at times (I am sorta aligned to Stoicism). I want to transcend beyond the norms, and do things that *actually matter.*

I love my work ethic and my process of creation. I tend to be workaholic sometimes, and love my work (apart from meaningless school stuff).

You can read about my beliefs [here](/beliefs/), although it is very, very incomplete.

Few of my blogs that display some of my personality:

*   [I am an addict](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict)- a poem I wrote in my native language
*   [why do I study?](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study)
*   [when you have metamorphosised](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised)

I also love working on productivity and cognition systems: Obsidian, Spaced Repetition, workflows, AI, etc. 
I can also help you reach out to people that knows things beyond my understanding (I have a few friends whom I count on, for their *expert* guidance).

### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi, Sanskrit (a bit); in that order of proficiency. An aspiring researcher; published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about environment in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I am eager to attend more programs/camps. And the goal here is to learn new things and skills that make me a better person and help me do great things for the world.

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am very particular about replying times. People close to me *know* that I am very hard to reach. 

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, and want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org)
