## TL;DR

I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

After my exams ended in November, I fell in a deep productivity rut. [It wasn't nice](https://visionoflife.substack.com/p/being-stuck-in-a-rut-is-not-fine). I am back at square one, but I have one advantage: more experience than my previous self, and I think that will help me become a better human (something like the game Hades).

So, I have been [trying to improve my focus](https://fatebook.io/q/will-i-reach-20h-deep-work-week-by-the--cm4qqi21l0000fm0rdho6fvgr) and getting back my curiosity. Scholzian Resilience helps a lot. I am also waking up a bit early these days, and trying to sleep early (the latter is hard, given my workaholism). I am also doing study-with-me livestreams on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nibirsankar) (at 2pm IST and 7pm IST) to be more accountable for my actions. Do join my streams. Let's study together ðŸ”¥

I had to leave the philosophy [course](https://github.com/moiSentineL/oxford-general-philosophy-2009) I was doing because I couldn't make time for it, and there was very little reading material. So, I couldn't follow after a certain point. But thankfully I found a [course on Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/) (as of writing this, I am on Week 1). I am especially enjoying the abstract-ness of mathematics. Formal Logic feels like a bridge between philosophy and math, and boy I am liking it! (mathematical masochism). 

If you're interested in math, and or philosophy, I would love to have a chat with you. Please [reach out](#okay%2C-you-seem-cool-enough%2C-where-can-i-reach-you%3F)!

Some New and Old Habits:
- Meditation Streak - 145 Days ðŸ”¥
- Waking up at 7am
- Tracking Focus and Energy levels after Deep Work Sessions.
- Using [fatebook.io](https://fatebook.io/) to track decisions.
- Regular doses of coffee (starting ~9am, max 2pm)
- Using [Anki as Reading List](https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/p/cron-for-the-mind).

Lately, I've been obsessed with [Linux](https://github.com/moiSentineL/dotfiles), A7X, [productivity tools](https://github.com/moiSentineL/Tomato.C) for no reason.

## This year

My main themes for this year are:

- **Work**: Focusing on both formal education and self education
- **Health**: Creating better systems
	- via habits, ritualisation and tracking
- **Relationships**: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents
- **Personal Growth**: Seeking the virtuous life
	- imo "virtuous" = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)

Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.

## No but, who are you exactly?

The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. I mean, why *should* it happen?

I am someone who likes thinking *very* much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and deriving overcomplicated, mathematical solutions to day-to-day problems (like choosing which soap I should buy). Just Kidding! Although it does seem like that when I throw terms like "confirmation bias" or "statistical base-rate" around.

I think of myself as curious. I like doing a lot of things: learning new things, math, reading, philosophy, livestreaming, making music and videos, writing and the list goes on. **But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create *meaningful* stuff.**

I love my work ethic and the process of creation and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a *bit* workaholic and ambitious at times. 

My philosophy is inspired by:
- Stoicism
- Rationality
- Digital Minimalism
- Doing things that matter
- James Scholz (my idol)

I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself. I also love building better systems using Anki/SRS, Obsidian and other productivity tools/techniques. I am a memory and psychology enthusiast.

I value deep and genuine connections with people. I am very much interested in meeting new people.

So, **I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday**.
### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi and Sanskrit (a bit), in that order of proficiency. Published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about the *environment* in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. 

Attended NYAS Junior Academy Fall '24 and yada yada. More on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nibirsankar).

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am not a very *reachable* person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org) (preferred)
*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
