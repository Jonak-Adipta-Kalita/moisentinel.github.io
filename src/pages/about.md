## TL;DR

I am a High Schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, looks out for self-improvement and loves autonomy. I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance), autodidactism, philosophy and math among many. I love talking to new people, music, reading and writing.

## Now

Making [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar) videos based on my writing. Also, [improving my math fundamentals](/blog/p/finding-attunement/) and searching for new opportunies and experiences. Upgrading my skills, so that I can focus on doing what really matters to me. Zoning in on knowledge working and augmenting cognition -> [search me, lol](/search/) 

Feel free to hit me up if you have anything to talk about relating to these stuff.

## This year


My main goals for this year are:

*   Becoming a knowledge worker- consume, consolidate, create.
*   Creating content- this blog, [newsletter](https://visionoflife.substack.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar) and [podcast](/pantheon/).
*   Getting more fit- health = wealth.
*   Spending more time with friends and family, and developing new connections
*   Becoming more confident- spread out and face fears, carpe diem.

## No but, who are you exactly?

I am that guy who tells you random facts about stuff just because they seem so exciting. I am fuelled by curiosity and the idea of helping people. I want to transcend beyond the norms.

Few of my blogs that shows some of my personality:

*   [I am an addict](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict)\- a poem I wrote in my native language
*   [why do I study?](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study)
*   [when you have metamorphosised](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised)

I can help you for stuff like productivity systems, Obsidian, workflows, books, etc. I can also help you reach out to people that knows things beyond my understanding.

### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi, Sanskrit (a bit); in that order of proficiency. An aspiring researcher; published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about environment in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I am eager to attend more programs/camps in the upcoming summer. I will be satisfied with anything that makes me learn new things, skills and makes me a better person.

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?
