## TL;DR

I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

The start of 2025 wasn't very great. My 8-year-old pet dog passed away, my family in shambles, my relationships took a toll, I had not prepped well for my exams, and so on. 

I managed to live through all this. I knew my responsibilities (as a son, student and a human) and I knew that I had to do them well. I knew [this life was going to be hard](/blog/p/notes-on-the-virtuous-life), and that's why I tried doing my best. Thankfully, my exams went well enough, and this month (Feb) has been much better than January. **I am healing.** 

I have some [themes for this year](/about/#this-year) which I want to work on. It required a significant amount of introspection to understand what I want and what needs improving. Journaling in an *active* way helped a lot. I have understood a lot about myself and life by writing my thoughts down, and I encourage you to try it as well!

I am still doing the [course on Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/), and it's so good that it is makes me want to pursue Discrete Math + Comp Sci for my undergrads. Though I can imagine it being *super* hard.

I have started a new workout routine (based on [this reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/fivvhv/the_quarantine_workout_template/)). It is completely made of bodyweight exercises. I realised I needed to step away from my previous routine ([Dumbbell Stopgap](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zc0uy/a_beginner_dumbbell_program_the_dumbbell_stopgap/)) to a more flexible and scalable one. So far so good! 
I've also started to eat better food and work on my diet plan. I think it is super cool and makes me feel proud about myself.

Some New and Old habits:
- Meditation Streak - 199 Days ðŸ”¥
- Study-with-me streams on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@nibirsankar/streams) (as much as I can)
- [Training to be ambidextrous](http://youtube.com/post/Ugkxi1AjYTWUxugBOT0FhWWMaHT5YttQ0D4c?si=fVkmzYZlYgx-U1FQ)
- Reading almost everyday.

Lately, I am obsessed with ThinkPads (T14 and T480!!!!), [fitness](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQgsKhHjSyRLOp9mnffqVg) and study plans.

## This year

My main themes for this year are:

- **Work**: Focusing on both formal education and self education
- **Health**: Creating better systems
	- via habits, ritualisation and tracking
- **Relationships**: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents
- **Personal Growth**: Seeking the virtuous life
	- imo "virtuous" = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)

Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.

## No but, who are you exactly?

The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. I mean, why *should* it happen?

I am someone who likes thinking *very* much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and deriving overcomplicated, mathematical solutions to day-to-day problems (like choosing which soap I should buy). Just Kidding! Although it does seem like that when I throw terms like "confirmation bias" or "statistical base-rate" around.

I think of myself as curious. I like doing a lot of things: learning new things, math, reading, philosophy, livestreaming, making music and videos, writing and the list goes on. **But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create *meaningful* stuff.**

I love my work ethic and the process of creation and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a *bit* workaholic and ambitious at times. 

My philosophy is inspired by:
- Stoicism
- Rationality
- Digital Minimalism
- Doing things that matter
- James Scholz (my idol)

I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself. I also love building better systems using Anki/SRS, Obsidian and other productivity tools/techniques. I am a memory and psychology enthusiast.

I value deep and genuine connections with people. I am very much interested in meeting new people.

So, **I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday**.
### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi and Sanskrit (a bit), in that order of proficiency. Published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about the *environment* in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. 

Attended NYAS Junior Academy Fall '24 and yada yada. More on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nibirsankar).

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am not a very *reachable* person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org) (preferred)
*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
