## TL;DR

I am a High Schooler (junior) from India who thrives to learn new things, looks out for self-improvement and loves autonomy. I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance), autodidactism, philosophy and math among many. I love talking to new people, music, reading and writing.

## Now

Learning [fundamentals of AI Safety](https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/home/alignment) as "extra reading" for [NYAS's Junior Academy](https://www.nyas.org/learning/high-school-research-programs/the-junior-academy/) 2024 Fall Cohort - "Ethical AI" Challenge, starting 23rd September. And as a consequence, I am learning a little [Linear Algebra](https://medium.com/sho-jp/towards-understanding-linear-algebra-part-1-d43710535503) and some Python as well. So far so good.

The second in priority is prepping for my unit test (starting 21st September), the first in this year, and I think it will be harder than all my previous exams. But that is all based on hearsay, so you can't really be sure. Although I trust my study system (Obsidian + Anki + eff. strats) to help me out on this one. 
Worst case scenario: I get to reflect on my mistakes.

Been maintaining a streak of meditating for 40 days straight (as of today), and a writing habit (wrote 6 [blogposts](/blog/archive/) and 3 [newsletters](https://run.nibirsan.org/substack/) In August; I'd say I am quite proud). 
But not making enough videos for the [series](https://run.nibirsan.org/explanatory), and it is something I have to work on...

well, stay frosty mates!

## This year

My main goals for this year are:

* Becoming a knowledge worker- consume, consolidate, create.
* Creating content- this blog, [newsletter](https://visionoflife.substack.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar) and [podcast](/pantheon/).
* Getting more fit- health = wealth.
* Spending more time with friends and family, and developing new connections
* Becoming more confident- spread out and face fears, carpe diem.

## No but, who are you exactly?

I am that guy who tells you random facts about stuff just because they seem so exciting. I am fuelled by curiosity and the idea of helping people. I want to transcend beyond the norms.

Few of my blogs that shows some of my personality:

*   [I am an addict](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict)\- a poem I wrote in my native language
*   [why do I study?](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study)
*   [when you have metamorphosised](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised)

I can help you for stuff like productivity systems, Obsidian, workflows, books, etc. I can also help you reach out to people that knows things beyond my understanding.

### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi, Sanskrit (a bit); in that order of proficiency. An aspiring researcher; published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about environment in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I am eager to attend more programs/camps in the upcoming summer. I will be satisfied with anything that makes me learn new things, skills and makes me a better person.

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?
