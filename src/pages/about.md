## TL;DR

I am a junior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, playing music, reading, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

After my exams ended in November, I fell in a deep productivity rut. [It wasn't nice](https://visionoflife.substack.com/p/being-stuck-in-a-rut-is-not-fine). I am back at square one, but I have one advantage: more experience than my previous self, and I think that will help me become a better human (something like the game Hades.)

So, I have been [trying to improve my focus](https://fatebook.io/q/will-i-reach-20h-deep-work-week-by-the--cm4qqi21l0000fm0rdho6fvgr) and getting back my curiosity. Scholzian Resilience helps a lot. I am also waking up a bit early these days, and trying to sleep early (the latter is hard, given my workaholism). I am also doing study-with-me livestreams on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nibirsankar) (at 2pm IST and 7pm IST. Do join!) to be more accountable for my actions. 

I had to leave the philosophy [course](https://github.com/moiSentineL/oxford-general-philosophy-2009) I was doing because I couldn't make time for it, and there was very little reading material. So, I couldn't follow after a certain point. But thankfully I found a [course on Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/) (as of writing this, I am on Week 1). I am especially enjoying the abstract-ness of mathematics. Formal Logic feels like a bridge between philosophy and math, and boy I am liking it! (mathematical masochism). 

If you're interested in math, and or philosophy, I would love to have a chat with you. Please [reach out](#okay%2C-you-seem-cool-enough%2C-where-can-i-reach-you%3F)!

Some New and Old Habits:
- Meditation Streak - 145 Days ðŸ”¥
- Waking up at 7am
- Tracking Focus and Energy levels after Deep Work Sessions.
- Using [fatebook.io](https://fatebook.io/) to track decisions.
- Regular doses of coffee (starting ~9am, max 2pm)
- Using [Anki as Reading List](https://vihaansondhi.substack.com/p/cron-for-the-mind).

Lately, I've been obsessed with [Linux](https://github.com/moiSentineL/dotfiles), A7X, [productivity tools](https://github.com/moiSentineL/Tomato.C) for no reason.

## This year

My main goals for this year are:

* Becoming a knowledge worker- consume, consolidate, create.
* Creating content- this blog, [newsletter](https://visionoflife.substack.com/), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar) and [podcast](/pantheon/).
* Getting more fit- health = wealth.
* Spending more time with friends and family, and developing new connections
* Becoming more confident- spread out and face fears, carpe diem.

## No but, who are you exactly?

The question of my existence is as absurd as the existence of the afternoon coffee in my mug. But yes, I do have a certain personality, which is hard to describe on paper. I will try my best.

I am that guy who is fueled by curiosity. I often need a "challenge" and hence I always try to learn something new. I like the idea of helping people, even though they can be jerks at times (I am sorta aligned to Stoicism). I want to transcend beyond the norms, and do things that *actually matter.*

I love my work ethic and my process of creation. I tend to be workaholic sometimes, and love my work (apart from meaningless school stuff).

Few of my blogs that display some of my personality:

*   [I am an addict](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/i-am-an-addict)- a poem I wrote in my native language
*   [why do I study?](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/why-do-i-study)
*   [when you have metamorphosised](https://moisentinel.github.io/blog/p/when-you-have-metamorphosised)

I also love working on productivity and cognition systems: Obsidian, Spaced Repetition, workflows, AI, etc. 
I can also help you reach out to people that knows things beyond my understanding (I have a few friends whom I count on, for their *expert* guidance).

### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi, Sanskrit (a bit); in that order of proficiency. An aspiring researcher; published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about environment in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. I am eager to attend more programs/camps. And the goal here is to learn new things and skills that make me a better person and help me do great things for the world.

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am not a very *reachable* person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org) (preferred)
*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
