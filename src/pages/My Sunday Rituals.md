I am a systems nerd. I like to replace agony with systems. And another thing I like is reflection. 

I value my weekends a lot. My Saturdays are completely devoted to *play*, passion projects and hobbies. While the Sundays are for reviewing, reflection and planning.

I do both a professional and personal reflection/review/planning. And so, my Sunday is divided into several parts. 

## Morning
I like to get first part of my personal reflection done in the morning. I call this **"Phase 1: Closure."** (There are total 3 phases).

I like to ask myself these questions:

- 🌗 Overall Feeling?
	- What 3 words describe my week?
	- Mental energy: 🟩🟨🟥
	- Physical: 🟩🟨🟥
	- Clarity: 🟩🟨🟥
- 🌹 What went well?
- 📉 What drained me?
- 🌍 Wheel of Life Check
(rating b/w 1-4)

| Work       | Health | Relationships |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Money: 1/4 | Mind   | Romance       |
| Growth     | Body   | Family        |
| Vision     | Soul   | Friends       |

- 🧠 Dumb Patterns I Repeated?
- ⚙ systems that I tried last week

Usually this takes about <25m.
I also do a few leftover tasks from the week (usually hobby related in the morning session.)

## Afternoon
I shift to a scholar mode here. I start around 1:30pm IST (but it really varies), and do some deep work for about 4 hours.

Here's what my professional (as in, STUDY) review consists of. I call this the "Ultrareview," inspired by the Ultralearning method.

### Act 1: Recall Dump (~30m)
I take a blank sheet of paper and dump everything I learned this week (that I can think of). I write formulae, problem-solving strategies, and almost any information that I can remember.

By leveraging active recall, you can see right away where you feel friction, what is clear and what is not. 

### Act 2: Triage (~10m)
From that paper, I triage the information into three categories:
1. 🟩 cool, but need some polishing
2. 🟨 might be worth revisiting
3. 🟥 okay, bro, you MUST learn it again. 

This helps figuring out what needs a deep dive and what does not.

### Act 3: Consolidate (~30m)
This involves making simple tl;dr like Obsidian notes and Anki flashcards that capture the gist of what the topic is. 

Things I like to include:
- Problem solving strategies
- My intuition
- Sources
- The *Why*

But not every topic needs Obsidian notes (a simple Anki card would suffice). I am still working on my ability to pick the necessary topic to write notes on.

### Act 4: Retrieval (~30m)
[Deliberate Practice.](https://fs.blog/deliberate-practice-guide/)

I go to my Anki, create a filtered deck (`F`), and do all the cards for created that week:

```
deck:Default added:7
```

I would usually have blank cards on which I have written only the questions, and in this session, I might try filling in the gaps (if needed), or stylize my flagged cards for the long-term.

### Act 5: Meta-reflection (~15m)
At the end of the review session, I ask myself these questions:

- What method worked best? (e.g., problem sets, active recall, peer teaching?)
- What was a time-waster?
- What do I want to tweak in my workflow?
- What should I do **less of**, and what should I double down on?
- What topic(s) need a second pass next week?

You'd often find some really interesting information.

And we are done with the Ultrareview. I am left with some time, I would usually do some writing or leftover blog.

## Evening
I do the remaining two phases of my personal review/reflection.
I like to pair this with some nice ambient music. Thanks to [myNoise.net](https://mynoise.net) for being and amazing resource.

### Phase 2: Strategic Debrief
#### 🏹 War Reflection
-  **🏆 What specific wins did I have this week?**
	✅ Focus on outcomes you actually did, not vague feelings.
	e.g., “Finished 3 math chapters,” “Did 5/5 planned workouts,” “Fixed my sleep 3 days”
- **💥 Where did I fail or fall short—and why?**
	💣 What did I plan but not do? What broke down?
	e.g., “Planned to review chem but skipped it 3 times. Got distracted by YouTube.”
- **🌋 What skills, habits, or mindset shifts improved this week?**
	🔧 Look for internal growth. What became easier, smoother, or more natural?
	e.g., “Started asking better questions during math,” “Did focused study without timers.”
- **💤 What routines or tasks are too easy and not helping me grow anymore?**
	🧱 What feels productive but is actually low-effort coasting?
	e.g., “Passive rereading notes,” “Highlighting without retrieval,” “Solving only easy problems”
- **🧙 What’s the one challenge next week that will require the most effort, focus, or courage?**
	🐉 The real dragon. The thing you’re avoiding but must face.
	e.g., “Start writing physics notes from scratch,” “Fix my late-night doomscrolling”
#### ⌛ Deep Work Stats
- 💡 Best Session:
- ⏱️ Total Study Time:
- 😩 Where I Struggled:

- 💥 Most Valuable Thing I Learned?

This one is the *core* of the reflection process. I usually have my wins logged on [this site](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/wins/), so it helps to know exactly what I did. I also use [Timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/) to track the time I spend on my [computer](/tech/).

### Phase 3: Recalibration
- 🎯 Next Week’s Focus (1 task each)
	- Learn:
	- Build:
	- Improve:

- 🧠 Themes / Intentions
	e.g. “Be decisive.” “Reduce switching.” “Start earlier.”

- 🪓 The "Stop Doing" List
- 🌱 What systems could be improved?
- ⚙ systems I will try next week
- 🧱 Lessons to Keep in Mind

- 🔋 Are you sure of your path?
	- [ ] Hell yes
	- [ ] Kinda
	- [ ] I need to fix some shit

- 📌 Weekly Quote / Reminder:
	“Don’t argue with the week. Rewrite it.”

This part sets me up for the next week. And so, this part is crucial as well. Sometimes I would pair this up with some good ol' [forecasting](https://fatebook.io/).

And that's all about my Sunday rituals. I hope you will set up your own as well!
It's amazing, really.
