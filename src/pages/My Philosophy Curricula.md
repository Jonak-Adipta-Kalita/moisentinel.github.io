I am a very big philosophy nerd who likes to ponder upon abstract ideas and bore people to death by having deep discussions out of nowhere.

I have read bits and pieces of philosophical ideas before, but I haven't had a "formal" introduction to philosophy. So, the main motive of this checklist is to get up to speed with thousands of years of philosophy, at least on a very basic level.

Eventually, I aim to be able to comprehend philosophical ideas on a deeper level and have better arguments with people. Also, I want to read Nietzsche.
