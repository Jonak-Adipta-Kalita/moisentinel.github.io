Hi there! I am **Nibir Sankar** from Assam, India. I am currently in High School, searching for a meaningful life.

I am a lifelong learner, knowledge seeker and a (future) polymath. I am really interested in philosophy, math and literature. I also love to write (hence, my [blog](/blog/)), read, play music and seek those 1% gains while tweaking my workflows. And I love thinking.

If you find this short bio enough to tickle your curiosity, learn more [about me](/about/) (and reach out!). You _should_ subscribe to my [newsletter](https://visionoflife.substack.com/) though...
