This is my way of living. My guiding philosophy.
It helps me become calmer, patient, less scattered, and remain *human*.

## The Essence

This way of living is rhythmic, not linear. Organic, not mechanical. Alive.
It contains spirit, it breathes, and it grows.

It takes many forms, yet it boils down to one thing: stillness — peace, clarity, humility.

My North Stars — **learning, creating, caring, reflecting**.

## The Three Orders

All action and thought revolve around **balance**.

Conflicts and tension are merged, not fought. Challenges become learning, struggle becomes art.
### Structural Order
Rhythm, anchor rituals, pillars that stabilize focus and flow.
This is the *flexible* skeleton that grounds me.

**My current pillars:**
- **Sleep**: to rest and recover.
- My puppy, **Captain**: to care and grow. 
- **Daily deep work** (learning/creative): to sharpen myself.
- **School** and environments I had labelled as "unworthy": to practice patience and attunement.
### Psychological Order
Awareness, presence, attunement, reflection. 

This is about being *internally* harmonious between my dualities by *oscillating* instead of suppressing.

**My dualities:**
- Aesthetics vs Ethics
- Control vs Trust
- Ambition vs Contentment
- Flow vs Disclipline

And the *meta*-duality: the impulse to *master* vs the need to *flow*.

**How?** By doing balancing activities. 
Examples: 
- Studying <-> Reading
- Planning <-> Reflecting
- Optimising <-> Accepting

### Environmental Order
Space, sound, light, companions — shaping the world to support calm and growth.
This is making sure the environment reflects the self I want to become.

This is about being less cluttered, less distracted, and more collected.

## The Daily Flow

- My day is not rigid, not a prison.
- My day *becomes* what it needs to be.
- My anchor rituals ground me; my pillars stabilize me.
- I am present, aligned, and aware.
- **I become less of a grouch**, more attuned to myself and others.
- Less seriousness, more sincerity.

## Core Declarations

- I grow. My way of living grows.
- I touch my North Stars daily — **learning, creating, caring, reflecting**.
- I cultivate environment and habits that honor spirit and curiosity.
- I merge aesthetics and ethics, creation and duty, flow and structure.
- I redirect chaos into clarity.

>I am aligned. I am present. **I am here, I am now.**
>I live attuned. I create. I learn. I breathe.
