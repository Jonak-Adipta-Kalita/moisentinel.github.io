Let's be honest here, once you get to know *why* working out is one of the most important things you can do, you can **never** go back. That's what happened to me. 

No, it's not like I like to spend 12h per day in the gym- in fact, I don't go to the gym- but working out *in general* is a **must** for me.

So, here's what I do for 4 days a week:

- There are 2 workouts- `upper` and `lower`- targeting respective muscle groups.
- It goes like: `RULRULRR` (`R` for rest).
- Bodyweight/weights based. No equipment other than a pull up bar.
- Check note on Diet at the end of the page here.

I started bodyweight training around 1.5years ago, and since then a lot of things have changed. I switched to this workout about 5-6 months ago, and I can *feel* things.

## Upper Body Workout

As of 3rd Aug, 2025, this workout consists of:

1. Horizontal Push - Inclined Push-ups
	- 3 sets 
2. Horizontal Pull - Inverted Row substitute - Bedsheet Row*
	- 3 sets 
3. Triceps Isolation - Overhead Triceps extension with a backpack
	- 2 sets @ ~5kg
4. (Vertical Pull) - Negative Chin Ups
5. Biceps Isolation - Backpack Bicep Curls
	- 3 sets @ ~5kg
6. Forearms - Backpack twists
	- 2 sets @ ~3kg

I have stopped doing Vertical Pulls for some time because I cannot really go up. Moreover, I don't really feel my back with Bedsheet Rows*, so I am actually trying to find a better back/pull exercise here.

## Lower Body Workout

As of 3rd Aug, 2025, this workout consists of:

1. Heavy Quad Compound - Bulgarian Split Squat
	- 3 sets
2. Hamstrings - Sliding Hamstring Curls (with incline)
	- 3 sets
3. Medium Quad Compound - (weighted) Step Ups
	- 2 sets @ ~4kg
4. Calf Raises
	- 4 sets (might add weight)
5. Abs - superset
	1. Dead Bug - 2 sets
	2. Knee Raises while laying down - 2 sets
	3. Hollow Body Hold (finisher)

This actually works pretty well for me (except for the Abs part). 
I think have a stronger lower body than upper.

For warming up and cooling down, I just follow [this](https://archive.is/k6LFK). {{.edit}}

## Diet

Because working out doesn't do shit if you don't eat well.

**Main rule:** Less Junk, More Healthy.

I don't like eating out. I like to eat homemade food that my mom cooks. Sure, sometimes you go out with friends, and that's okay.

You need loads of protein. I don't really like meat that much (not a vegetarian though), so I eat eggs a lot, and paneer. I also take Whey Protein.

I am currently on a maintainance diet (no surplus or deficit), though I don't really track my macros. There's only so much you can do when you have so much to do. 

And so I just try to follow the main rule, have as much proteins as I can, and eat whatever my mom cooks. Thankfully she doesn't cook too many fatty dishes.

## Misc

- Instead of focusing on reps and sets, focus more on tempo, form and controlled movement. That's more important.
- You gotta track your weight. 
	- Mine stays around 65-66kg. 
	- I don't if that's normal, though it used to be 66-67kg not so long ago. 
	- So, improvement?
- Recovery is important. You gotta rest your muscle groups both during workouts and after.
