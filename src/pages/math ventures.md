I have been studying Serge Lang's [Basic Mathematics](https://amzn.to/3UElWTL)  with the help of Real Physics' [lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMcpDl1Pr-viA25VUkHNmcUkWx9usPgyb&si=W4iXHhkpfITEBTtL) to up my "game" in maths. I want to revisit the fundamentals and develop a better foundation. 

I am hoping to finish the book by the end of June. I haven't "grinded" textbooks this way before, but I know that this is going to be a great experience. 

This is where I update things and tell you all about the things I have learned.
