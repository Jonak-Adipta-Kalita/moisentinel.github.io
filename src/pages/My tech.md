# Tech I use
![](https://media.tenor.com/hVX6r4kDu00AAAAj/ai-grok.gif)

## Laptops
### Daily Driver
- ThinkPad T14 Gen2a
	- Ryzen 5 5650U
	- 16GB RAM

This is a fucking GOOD laptop.
I run a minimal, but pleasing Arch config with <s>Hyprland</s> BSPWM, which works seemingly well for my needs and helps me focus.
### Muscle
- Acer Nitro AN515-52 
	- i5-8300H (undervolted)
	- GTX 1050Ti 4GB
	- 16GB RAM

Although it is kinda old and has a broken hinge, it still has enough power to handle some heavy editing and streaming. So, I use it for that, and also sometimes as a self-hosted server.

I find having another PC extremely helpful in keeping me focused and avoid any unforeseen calamities (crashing, freezes, etc). 
### Retired Veteran
- HP Pavillion 15-r033tx
	- i3-4005U
	- GT 820M
	- 4GB RAM

My first laptop; ran super well for 10+ years. Retired and dormant, but not senile. It still has the oomph to run several tabs and be a stable guy in times of need (has BSPWM+Linux Mint; much more stable.)
## The Rig
Along with the laptops, I use these things at my desk to (sort of) improve my productivity.

- MSI MP423 Monitor
- M-Audio M-Track Solo Audio Interface
- Mic: Behringer Ultravoice XM8500
- Wacom CTL-472 Graphics Tablet

I use an ergonomic mouse and a keyboard with the Colemak layout. Aah I love the Extend layer! 
## Other Devices
### E-reader: Kobo Clara BW
I recently got this Kobo e-reader to read books, papers, and so on. It has been a wonderful experience so far. It is very pleasant to read. My only wish is that I want to review my Anki decks on this device^[It is possible on Android e-ink devices like Onyx Boox Palma, but they are WAYYY too expensive for me].

I use KO-Reader with this.
### (Only Phone) Redmi Note 9 Pro Max
I have dumbed out my phone, mostly using apps like ScreenZen and the Before Launcher. I've hidden most of the apps, and don't use too many of them.

I also use this phone as my primary camera for my streams.
### Camera: Sony Cybershot DSC-W830
I use this point and shoot camera to take pictures whenever I go out. I don't typically use my phone to take pictures. It feels great actually.

But unfortunately, the image stabilizer doesn't work that great anymore.
## Software 
### OS
- Arch Linux on the T14
- EndeavourOS (Arch-based) on the Nitro
