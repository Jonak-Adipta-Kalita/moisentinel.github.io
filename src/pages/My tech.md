### Main Workspace
- Acer Nitro AN515-52 
	- i5-8300H (undervolted)
	- GTX 1050Ti 4GB
	- 16GB RAM
- MSI MP423 Monitor
- M-Audio M-Track Solo Audio Interface
- Mic: I really forgot 
- Wacom CTL-472 Graphics Tablet

I run a minimal, but pleasing Arch config with <s>Hyprland</s> BSPWM, which works seemingly well for my needs and helps me focus. 

I use an ergonomic mouse and a keyboard with the Colemak layout. Aah I love the Extend layer! 
### Stream Rig / Secondary 
- HP Pavillion 15-r033tx
	- i3-4005U
	- GT 820M
	- 4GB RAM

I find having another PC extremely helpful in keeping me focused and avoid any unforeseen calamities (crashing, freezes, etc). 

Having a separate PC just for streaming allows me to stop worrying and do what truly matters (study!!). (I use a BSPWM+Ubuntu rig, a much stable and safe system)
### Other Devices
#### E-reader: Kobo Clara BW

I recently got this Kobo e-reader to read books, papers, and so on. It has been a wonderful experience so far. It is very pleasant to read. My only wish is that I want to review my Anki decks on this device^[It is possible on Android e-ink devices like Onyx Boox Palma, but they are WAYYY too expensive for me].

I use KO-Reader with this.
#### (Only Phone) Redmi Note 9 Pro Max
I have dumbed out my phone, mostly using apps like ScreenZen and the Before Launcher. I've hidden most of the apps, and don't use too many of them.

I also use this phone as my primary camera for my streams.
#### Camera: Sony Cybershot DSC-W830
I use this point and shoot camera to take pictures whenever I go out. I don't typically use my phone to take pictures. It feels great actually.

But unfortunately, the image stabilizer doesn't work that great anymore.
