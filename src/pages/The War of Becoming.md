How much nagging will you take? How much longer will you wait to go beyond your comfort zone and seek challenges? How much will you let the others control *you*? 

This is a page dedicated to the war I have declared on comfort, mediocrity and tradition. This is how I seek the [virtuous life](https://nibirsan.org/blog/p/notes-on-the-virtuous-life/) and improve perpetually in mind, body and spirit. It's time to become an Übermensch War General.

## who am I and why am I doing this?
I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. 

And I am tired of being stuck in my comfort zone with my nagging parent in this cesspool of a system. This is really not something I want.

- When I should've been learning, I am finishing mundane assignments.
- When I should've been building something good, I am compelled not to by my own laziness.
- When I should've been chasing mastery, I am chasing attendance in school.
- **When I should've been transcending, I am stopped by the system.**

But I am different: I am cannot be put in one box. I am sure as hell *not* going to be conformed by this hell. 

And this is the way it's going to go: **I am going to escape the system by beating the system.** I am going to become **inevitable** and make **my own life** and cherish it with all my heart.

And so, I have declared a **war of becoming**. 
### the mission: becoming an [Übermensch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdNpNGqi0Ks), escaping academic hell, creating something better.

#### How?
- **Academics**: using Progressive Overload, efficient study techniques and deep work.
- **Physical**: letting go of comfort, physical exercise as a part of identity.
- **Mental**: seeking equanimity and accepting everything as *your* responsibility.
- **Spiritual**: Loving fate (*amor fati*), embracing joy.

And so much more. The Last Destination: *becoming* out of your own league.
#### But!
- This is not going to be easy. I will suffer.
- This needs extreme focus.
- This takes time.
- This requires you to **let go**. No more bullshitting.
## the 7 commandments
1. **I do deep, meaningful work. I do not fuck around.**  
    This life is too short for mediocrity or bullshit.
2. **I am a problem-solving machine. I never settle.**  
    If it breaks, I fix it. If I fail, I learn. If I win, I raise the bar.
3. **Comfort is the enemy. I live with deliberate intensity.**  
    Pain is data. Struggle is the test. I choose the hard path—on purpose.
4. **I am a polymathic beast. I win across domains.**  
    I don’t fit in one box. I study everything, connect dots, and build systems.
5. **I am not here to study. I am here to _transform_.**  
    This is about mastery, not marks. Becoming, not conforming.
6. **I am ruthlessly focused. Calm, sharp, unshakeable.**  
    Equanimity under chaos. Laser-beam mind. Relentless improvement.
7. **I am done being mid. I am inevitable.**  
    No more playing small. I am building a future that rewrites the rules.

>Never settle. Never drift. Never waste pain.
## current limits
- Math
	- Problem-solving Intuitions
	- Number Theory and Patterns
- Systems
	- Time Management and Better Routines
## milestones
Most important achievements in this war.
- **2025-04-25** - Declared this War.
## project
Current Projects:
- [Project Math Machine](https://github.com/moiSentineL/war-of-becoming/blob/main/projects/project-math-machine.md): git gud at math and be able to solve some actual stuff.
## wall of failure
I learn from failure. And I transform.
- **2025-05-02** - I did not get into [RSI-India](https://www.cee.org/RSI_India). I did not have enough credentials to get through. I am not inevitable yet. 
## goals and forecasts
Ideal Expectations that I want to achieve.
### 6 Months
1. I'd be able to solve (easy-medium) Olympiad Level math problems
2. I'd be calmer, sharper and more focused.
3. I'll have a wide arsenal of mental model and heuristics which come in handy everywhere.
4. I will be more fit, get some gains and probably max out my current workout program.
5. I'd be more comfortable with being uncomfortable.
6. I'd be less of an imperfectionist
7. I'd have finished my 12th Grade syllabus and say a big "Fuck You!" to CBSE
8. I'd be much better at managing my schedule, not slacking off and optimising tings according to priorities.
9. I'd rest better and more healthily.
10. I'd have quitted porn forever.
11. I'd have gained some cooking skills, enough for survival.
12. I'd be starting the level 3 of [my philosophy curricula](/phil/).
13. I'd be a much better person and a much better thinker.
