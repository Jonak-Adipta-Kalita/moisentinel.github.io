A scholar needs to have a shit ton of resources that he/she can refer to for studying or learning. This is especially helpful if he/she is an [:autodidact](#:xautodidact).

Currently, I am starting my senior year of highschool in a CBSE school with an NCERT syllabus. And I **do not recommend reading the NCERT books at all, except for the exercises,** if you want to actually *learn* something.

>Learners optimise.

I adore these resources that I have listed to improve your knowledge and to have fun while studying.
