A scholar needs to have a shit ton of resources that he/she can refer to for studying or learning. This is especially helpful if he/she is an [[Memory system, Self Learning|autodidact]].

Currently, I am starting my senior year of highschool in a CBSE school with an NCERT syllabus. And I **do not recommend reading the NCERT books at all.** I adore these resources that I have listed to improve your knowledge and to have fun while studying.
