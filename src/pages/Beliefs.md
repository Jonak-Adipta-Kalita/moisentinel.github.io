This is a page on my beliefs on everything. From education to food, culture to death. There may not be many things there as I am still putting things one by one.

Note that my beliefs are [always susceptible to updates](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/high-speed-intro-to-bayes-s-rule).

## Formal Education 
1. Only the societal and cultural activities that you do as a byproduct of engaging in a formal education systems are actually worth something.
2. School is not about learning. It is about compliance.
3. Formal education systems is made only for the median students, and fallaciously suppresses the need of both the smart and the needful subsets of students.
4. The structure created by formal education is helpful, but it costs you time and mental bandwidth that can be better spent on learning things. The structure can be replicated in non-formal ways to reap all the benefits.
5. Schools and formal education systems do not emphasis on building intuition. The subject matter is presented as knowledge to be *apprehended* than being *attuned* to.
6. Methods such as homeschooling, *un*schooling and [aristocratic tutoring](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/sticky-humans-in-a-post-agi-%3Cbr%3Eworld) are far more potent in teaching a child and enhancing the possibilities of that child reaching a higher position in life.

## Polymathy
1. Since we are inherently explorers, polymathy is the most natural way of living one's life.
2. Polymathy promotes [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).
