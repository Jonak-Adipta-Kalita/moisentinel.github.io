Hey there! Welcome to my blog sort of thing. I _definitely_ don't post nonsensical stuff here. It's mostly about philosophy, life, people and observations. You're free to view the posts as you like, although there's the [archive](/blog/archive/) you can go to. You can also scroll down on this page and browse by #tags. 

Good luck! (you might really need it..) And if you want to keep coming for more, consider subscribing via [RSS](/feed.xml) to get new posts right into your virtual doorstep.

Use of [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) or any other web-highlighter is encouraged for a better internet, for all of us. Also, consider subscribing to my [newsletter](https://visionoflife.substack.com/).
