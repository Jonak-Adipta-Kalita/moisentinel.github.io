Hi there! Welcome to my brain dump. It contains stuff related to philosophy, life, tech, books, fiction, and other weird stuff.

You're free to read the posts as you like, but to get started:
- You can check the curated [top posts](/blog/top/)
- Or the [archive](/blog/archive/).
- There's also [fiction](/blog/fiction/).
- And [books](/blog/books/) + reviews.

You can also scroll down to the bottom of this page and browse by #tags. 

The navbar on the top will lead you to other parts of my website, including the [evergreen pages](/pages/) which contain more persistent notes on ideas, beliefs and life itself.

If you like what I write about, consider subscribing via [RSS](/feed.xml) to get new posts delivered right onto your virtual doorstep. Also, consider subscribing to my [newsletter/substack](https://visionoflife.substack.com/) for polished monthly digests.
