<em>"your blog gave me an existential crisis damn."</em>

Hey there! Welcome to my brain dump. It contains stuff related to philosophy, life, people, observations and the occasional musing on the absurdity of life. 

You're free to read the posts as you like, but to get started, you can  view the [top posts](/blog/top/) or the [archive](/blog/archive/). You can also scroll down to the bottom of this page and browse by #tags. 

I also have a [page](/pages/) for more evergreen and persistent notes you might want to have a look at.

If you like what I write about, and want to keep coming for more, consider subscribing via [RSS](/feed.xml) to get new posts right into your virtual doorstep. Also, consider subscribing to my [newsletter/substack](https://visionoflife.substack.com/) for more polished content.
