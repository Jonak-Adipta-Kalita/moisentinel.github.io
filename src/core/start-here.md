Hi there. I am Nibir.

I make things — videos, blog, code, and other weird stuff I can't talk about. I am also a scholar who loves thinking about math, philosophy and rationality. I am still in school, but I don't like it all. 
I am an autodidact / wannabe polymath. I am obsessed with better thinking, better systems, and squeezing meaning out of the mess.

[here's a longer version of the same stuff.](/about/)

I write about:
- philosophy, growth, weird life experiences
- productivity and systems (but not like those techbros with dopamine detox thumbnails)
- poems and kafkaesque stories
- math and logic

I look approximately like this:
