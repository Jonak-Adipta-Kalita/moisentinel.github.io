It's crazy to see how things can change *so much* within just a month. A lot of stuff happened in May and June till now. Everything is summarised in this video:

I also participated in a hackathon and failed miserably, realised that I am a [judge-penitent](https://nibirsan.org/blog/p/the-fall/), and did a shit ton of reflection on my self-imposed brainwashes that I had done to myself as a young teenager.

That was about the near *past*. Here's what I think I will be / am doing *now*:

- [grinding olympiad math](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/projects/project-math-machine/)
- make a custom reading list-anki-tracker-cli thing (or maybe goodreads > anki?)
- make a better, more streamlined content pipeline to create more engagement and a more aligned audience.
- [ultralearning](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/projects/project-ultralearning/)
- building better routine (w/ emphasis on sleep)

I think my life has taken a new and wonderful turn. I am really eager to see what happens. Check the goals for the month June [here](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/goals/).

**Some New and Old Habits:**
- Meditation Streak - 57 days ðŸ”¥
- Workout program is going OK-OK. I think I messed with my progression a bit
- Love reading! I should probably do more reviews and stuff.
- Trying to maintain 8hours of sleep + (11pm ~> 7am) sleep cycle. It's hard.

Lately, I have been obsessed with CLI/TUI tools, my ThinkPad and being a manchild in my mancave.
