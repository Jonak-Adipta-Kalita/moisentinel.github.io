Hi there! I am **Nibir Sankar** from Assam, India. I am currently in High School, searching for a meaningful life.

I am a lifelong learner, knowledge seeker and an aspiring polymath. I am really interested in philosophy, math and literature. I also love to write (hence, my [blog](/blog/)), read, play music and seek those 1% gains while tweaking my workflows. I love thinking, and I love **building**.
