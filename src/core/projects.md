i build things. some are useful. some are stupid. most are both.
some of them are not finished. some of them never will be. but we keep on building. [that's the way it works](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13).

also i have yet to add a lot of things, so this page is a WIP.
