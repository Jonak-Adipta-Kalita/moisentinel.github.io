## TL;DR

I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

Wow, things have been really fast since the last time I updated this. So, a couple of big-hitters: my 12th Grade started, *I* had full firmware update, and I did some travelling with my friends and family.

I felt that things were getting a bit serious after my fallow period ended and 12th Grade started. I needed to revamp my whole system in order to survive and do stuff efficiently. And so it happened:

- I renovated my Obsidian vault / capturing method / progress trackers.
- did a [Productivity Purge](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RaNhnNjExip36NMxM/advice-for-newly-busy-people)
- carried out some experiments with [physical note-taking](https://github.com/moiSentineL/war-of-becoming/blob/main/systems/my-physical-notetaking-system.md) for school
- and now declared a [war](https://github.com/moiSentineL/war-of-becoming) on mediocrity, comfort and tradition.

**Super stoked to see what's next.** 

Right now, my focus is on mostly these things:

1. Finishing Intro to Mathematical Thinking ([coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/home/))
2. Getting problem-solving intuition to further my math skills.
3. Live-streaming and Deep Work on my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@nibirsankar/streams).
4. Learning a bit of Nihongo/Japanese.
5. Fighting the [war](https://github.com/moiSentineL/war-of-becoming/) and becoming an Ubermensch War General.
6. Usual school stuff till Summer Vacay starts, then move on to doing some hardcore stuff and academic speedruns.

I have been reading some nice books lately, you can catch up [here](https://visionoflife.substack.com/p/books-i-enjoyed-recently). 

**Some New and Old Habits:**
- Meditation Streak - broke off due to a trip ðŸ˜”. back to 11 days
- Fitness journey go brr. I feel myself getting pumped!
- Reading everyday, oh yeah!
- Anki is back!

Lately, I have been obsessed with Vonnegut, pens (all kinds) and building *systems*.

## This year

My main themes for this year are:

- **Work**: Focusing on both formal education and self education
- **Health**: Creating better systems
	- via habits, ritualisation and tracking
- **Relationships**: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents
- **Personal Growth**: Seeking the virtuous life
	- imo "virtuous" = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)

Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.

## No but, who are you exactly?

I am an awareness trapped in a human body passing through space and time.

I am someone who likes thinking *very* much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and deriving overcomplicated, mathematical solutions to day-to-day problems (like choosing which soap I should buy). Just Kidding! Although it does seem like that when I throw terms like "confirmation bias" or "statistical base-rate" around.

I think of myself as curious. I like doing a lot of things: learning new things, math, reading, philosophy, livestreaming, making music and videos, writing and the list goes on. **But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create *meaningful* stuff.**

I love my work ethic and the process of creation and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a *bit* workaholic and ambitious at times. 

My philosophy is inspired by:
- Stoicism
- Rationality
- Digital Minimalism
- Doing things that matter
- James Scholz (my idol)

I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself. I also love building better systems using Anki/SRS, Obsidian and other productivity tools/techniques. I am a memory and psychology enthusiast.

I value deep and genuine connections with people. I am very much interested in meeting new people.

So, **I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday**.
### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi and Sanskrit (a bit), in that order of proficiency. Published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about the *environment* in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. 

Attended NYAS Junior Academy Fall '24 and yada yada. More on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nibirsankar).

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am not a very *reachable* person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org) (preferred)
*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
