## TL;DR

I am a senior high-schooler from India who thrives to learn new things, improve everyday and **create** good stuff. I love autonomy.

I am interested in [polymathy](/blog/p/another-renaissance) + autodidactism, [philosophy](/blog/t/philosophy/), [math](/blog/math/), [open-source](https://run.nibirsan.org/gh) among many. I love talking to new people, reading, playing music, writing and making stuff in my free time..

## Now

It's crazy to see how things can change *so much* within just a month. A lot of stuff happened in May and June till now. Everything is summarised in this video:

I also participated in a hackathon and failed miserably, realised that I am a [judge-penitent](https://nibirsan.org/blog/p/the-fall/), and did a shit ton of reflection on my self-imposed brainwashes that I had done to myself as a young teenager.

That was about the near *past*. Here's what I think I will be / am doing *now*:

- [grinding olympiad math](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/projects/project-math-machine/)
- make a custom reading list-anki-tracker-cli thing (or maybe goodreads > anki?)
- make a better, more streamlined content pipeline to create more engagement and a more aligned audience.
- [ultralearning](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/projects/project-ultralearning/)
- building better routine (w/ emphasis on sleep)

I think my life has taken a new and wonderful turn. I am really eager to see what happens. Check the goals for the month June [here](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming/goals/).

**Some New and Old Habits:**
- Meditation Streak - 57 days ðŸ”¥
- Workout program is going OK-OK. I think I messed with my progression a bit
- Love reading! I should probably do more reviews and stuff.
- Trying to maintain 8hours of sleep + (11pm ~> 7am) sleep cycle. It's hard.

Lately, I have been obsessed with CLI/TUI tools, my ThinkPad and being a manchild in my mancave.

## This year

My main themes for this year are:

- **Work**: Focusing on both formal education and self education
- **Health**: Creating better systems
	- via habits, ritualisation and tracking
- **Relationships**: Accepting family responsibilities and be closer to parents
- **Personal Growth**: Seeking the virtuous life
	- imo "virtuous" = stoicism + minimalism + prioritisation + absurdism)

Goals and Habits for each theme will be implemented on Quarterly and Weekly basis. The themes are inspired by Stoicism and the want to improve myself and how I handle things.

## No but, who are you exactly?

I am an awareness trapped in a human body passing through space and time.

I am someone who likes thinking *very* much. I love dwelling on philosophical questions and deriving overcomplicated, mathematical solutions to day-to-day problems (like choosing which soap I should buy). Just Kidding! Although it does seem like that when I throw terms like "confirmation bias" or "statistical base-rate" around.

I think of myself as curious. I like doing a lot of things: learning new things, math, reading, philosophy, livestreaming, making music and videos, writing and the list goes on. **But there's only one end goal. That is, to do something that actually matters, to create *meaningful* stuff.**

I love my work ethic and the process of creation and the endorphins it releases, though I can be a *bit* workaholic and ambitious at times. 

My philosophy is inspired by:
- Stoicism
- Rationality
- Digital Minimalism
- Doing things that matter
- James Scholz (my idol)

I appreciate updating my beliefs and trying to improve myself. I also love building better systems using Anki/SRS, Obsidian and other productivity tools/techniques. I am a memory and psychology enthusiast.

I value deep and genuine connections with people. I am very much interested in meeting new people.

So, **I am a scholar, a builder and a person who improves everyday**.
### Flexing (i don't do that anymore)

I am a self-taught guitarist, programmer, musician. I know and speak several languages: Assamese (Native), English, Hindi and Sanskrit (a bit), in that order of proficiency. Published a [paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ytwqd/) about the *environment* in my region.

I participated in YUVIKA '23 (Young Scientist Programme) held by ISRO and was a participant in ANVIKA '23 Programme hosted by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. 

Attended NYAS Junior Academy Fall '24 and yada yada. More on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nibirsankar).

## Okay, you seem cool enough, where can I reach you?

I am not a very *reachable* person. Anyone who knows me personally would know that this is normal behavior.

But don't fear! If you like what I am doing, or want to talk about something **interesting**, drop a DM or an email: 

*   [Email](mailto:nibir@nibirsan.org) (preferred)
*   Discord- `@moisentinel`
