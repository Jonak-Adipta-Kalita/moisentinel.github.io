These is the collection of my **"evergreen"** notes or pages, which are more persistent and reflect more about me than my blogposts. 

These might also help someone in need of some inspiration or ideas in some specific cases, like a [philosophy curricula](/phil/), or [study resources](/resources/). 

Also, check how I am **[building myself into a better person in public](https://nibirsan.org/war-of-becoming)**.

(work in progress, forever.)
