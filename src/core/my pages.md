These is the collection of my **"evergreen"** pages, which are more persistent and reflect more about me than my blogposts. 

These might also help someone in need of some inspiration or ideas in some specific cases, like a [philosophy curricula](/phil/), or [study resources](/resources/). 

(work in progress, forever.)
