I have two faces. One is distinguished, clean and meticulous. And the other is rather chaotic looking, animal-ish and indulgent. I wear them as I see fit, like changing clothes. It is really easy. I don't have to try too hard. 

My faces have their own conscience. Sometimes *they* are in control of me. I usually think that me and my faces are different entities, but sometimes I am led to question that.

They fight. They fight for power, consequently draining my energy. And the disputes are harder to resolve, since I am not the one in control. 

My faces are like double-headed serpents. Because even though they fight, their actions are aligned to maliciously exploit me and my integrity. Two heads and one body churning my bones.

But they don't know that I possess another face. The face of reality, truth and righteousness. I am damn sure the other faces will run with their tails between their legs to hide from it.

The only problem is that I lost it a long ago.
