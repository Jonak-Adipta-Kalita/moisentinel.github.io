First of all, we don't know if God exists or not. I don't think there's a way to prove it. (Descarte's way of finding god. was in my opinion, buffoonery). But let's say away we found to prove that it exists. What changes will it bringing? Perhaps people will start to ponder upon another question: "*Whose* god is this?"

What if it isn't what we thought all along? What if it isn't a supernatural, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient being? What if God is not "God"? 

And what about the possibility that God is **Evil**? We haven't considered that yet, have we?
I read it for the first time in [existentialcomics.com](https://existentialcomics.com/comic/535), and then I discussed the topic with my friends.
That question intrigues me. What if, really, God is Evil?

That would change everything, or maybe not. There are a few plausible outcomes: people will then stop believing in God, or blame others: "It's YOUR God" unlike if God is good: "It's OUR God". Or something completely different altogether. Perhaps it will change their standards. "Evil" will become the new "good", as jain put it.

It will turn out as a nightmare and existential crisis, if the God, which is evil, really made us. If it did, then did it make us all evil, a part of itself. Is this why violence comes naturally to us?

This is all a big IF though, since **we don't really know**.

Now, let us suppose we don't know if it exists (which we really don't; i.e, reality], does it really matter if it is evil, or good, or dumb? Maybe to me it doesn't, and to some rationalists, atheists, agnostics, EAs, etc. either.

But, the majority yet suffers. A banal attempt to put "God" in place of "good" and "truth". They can't quite "un-believe" yet. It's their faith, their only solace, how could they deny? 

The word "God" is created by man, interpretations are made by man, and confusions are caused by man. Well, bunch of rational creatures, aren't we?

It's something entirely different. We're just substituting. In my opinion, we're not capable enough to truly understand the gist. There's no way to conclude anything.
