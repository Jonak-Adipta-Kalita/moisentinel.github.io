A story that grips you and doesn't let go. Every chapter, you'd find yourself wondering what the fuck is happening. You think you and the protagonist are *this* close to finding the answer, but you're not. It's a giant game, and you're not about to win just yet.

The prose is well written and truly makes you feel you're in a Victorian mansion. Seems like it's not written by a contemporary writer, but it is; an impressive example of literary fiction in this century. And beneath it all is time-travelling, mystery and science fiction, and it's not *explicitly* stated. There's no hyperadvanced technology. No machines. Just your mind, and that is the beauty of *The 7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle*. 

This is not just a murder mystery-drama novel, but an amazingly constructed psychological narrative. I have to commend Turton's brilliance here for making sure every detail, object, thing mentioned in the story plays a role. Every moment is a foreshadow. Every scene is a clue.

I couldn't stop reading this story. It was a complete pageturner. Even though, it may not have been a "deep", or philosophical book, it is certainly a nice lit-fic, with an impressive "hero" arc and a massive fan-fiction potential.

Very cool. Very nice. Liked it very much. 5/5
