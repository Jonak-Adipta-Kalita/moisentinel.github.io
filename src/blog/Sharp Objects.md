Gillian Flynn's *Sharp Objects* is a page-turner full of psychological malevolence, disorders and dysfunctional households. This book is a sacrilegious representation of how our childhood is *not* always idyllic, and often the cause of many, many problems.

I had first read this book in 2022, and I read it again last September. Surely, my understanding of the book and the characters has evolved in the past two years. Everyone in the story is pitiable. You don't really like anybody, and everyone has *some* flaw which, as a whole, represents the defective aspect of humanity.

It gives me a sad feeling that not all people have good childhood; it can leave a mark and stop them from *living*. Trauma seeps in to the child and manifest itself as a poor guide in the adult future.

This book is about re-living one's dreadful past and facing the same wrath they faced as a child, now as an adult. And it shows how powerful, how utterly powerful that force is. How it damages you, crushes you- *everything* inside you.

This book is not for the faint-hearted. It is still as disturbing as the first time I had read it.
