May contain spoilers, or maybe not. See for yourself.
## Things I learned/enjoyed/liked
#### Story of Jesus and Pontius Pilate
I would never have searched about it otherwise. There are somethings you should know, even if you are not a follower of Christianity. Moreover, it was very interesting to know that Jesus was in fact, [a real person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus) and that he is also a prominent figure in [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam) and [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_Jesus) other than Christianity. 
#### Soviet Lifestyle and Stalinism
Everybody knows that this is a satire of the Soviet life in the Stalin era. I still feel that I could've better interpreted the metaphors if I had researched the history, rather than referring to Pevear and Volokhonsky's notes.
#### Nihilism, Despair and Tragedy
The master is a tragedy in a whole. After being devastatingly humiliated, the master lost his purpose. He was now content with the feeling of unworthiness. Only Margarita brings life into his story.
#### Courage and Bravery but morally grey
Margarita's character is flamboyant as ever, but with it's own flaws. We must not forget that she and the master are also humans. And humans, as ever, are truly [paradoxical](https://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/sdg/paradox.html).
She is brave enough to make a deal with the Satan to save her lover. But on the way she makes some decisions that makes you hate her.
She's not perfect, but she's loyal.
#### Humour 
It's important to point out Behemoth's humour, who is probably my favourite character in this book. Pair him with his best buddy Koroviev, and you get a deadly duo.
Behemoth brings a different shade into the book and you gotta look out for it.
#### Russian Literature references
Wooooooooo. I am like a fangirl when it comes to Russian Literature.
Wouldn't I like it when Behemoth says "Dostoevsky is immortal!"?
#### Manuscripts Don't Burn
The truth can never be hidden. You may be punished for it, ridiculed for it, but they'll realise it sooner or later. Then you'll be praised. 
#### Mad Love
Margarita's capacity to put up with master's nihilistic sentiments is wonderful. She never lost hope for him, and it is commendable. What makes a person be so dedicated in love?
#### Brutal self-discovery
Ivan's realisation came at a cost of his friend's murder, meeting an unbelievably mystical being and talking with an already dead person. But that's not the point. 
The point is that, much like Ivan Ilyich's (Tolstoy) revelation, he went through a drastic change as a result of introspection. It's crazy what disasters can bring to people. 
It's better sooner than late.

I hope to read it again in 5-6 years.
