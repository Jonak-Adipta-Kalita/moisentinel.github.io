Appetite to sleep
On long queues
Suppressing the
Urge to dream.

A bad stomach, 
A bad leg or hand
Forces me to become
Drowsy as ever.

Awaiting a deep slumber, I sit
For the meeting to end
For the next to begin.
And as drowsy as ever,
The ode to sleep is formed.

Come Hypnos, take me
To your land, the endless,
Vast land of forever night.
I seek a long, dreamy sleep.
