The cranium
still desecrates the sphere.

Voraciousness, 
Continues to crumble
the Spirit, the Substance,
of Everything. 

Creating vortices of
"shitting where you eat"
and still, 

Bags of meat, flesh and bones,
Shaped like humans 
Celebrate in vain, 
the end of some 365 days. 
And the start of some other 365 days,
Another year, another broken embrace.
