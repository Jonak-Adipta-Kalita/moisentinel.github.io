Electrophile and Nucleophile blah blah blah some geometric isomerism yada yada yada forms SN1 something SN2 with clockwise and anticlockwise yes yes uhuh nod. Don't think too much, just read it with technical difficulties and yes some isomer and reversed inversion uhuh. Why aren't you writing this down, Nibir.  Why aren't you studying? Why do I always have to repeat, repeat, repeat? Sorry, ma'am. No! Write, teach, do, here, why, then, how, okay, hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, iron oxide.

Some RCN and RNC molecules and ambidentate nucleophile bites me in the ass. I am so tired. Covalent ionic bonding and loathe yourself. Think! Something's happening somewhere, but not here. Why should it? Why must it?

I am learn organic chemistry while dying out of boredom and too many amphetamines. September. October. Dead. Great students off-white perspective off and self-made losers. Gratitude. Guided meditation.

I am not a teenage girl, and not an emo kid, just stuck with hydrogen bombs and stale graphite I cannot eat. Remember, KCN is predominantly ionic. Domination. Conquest. Wine and sodium phenobarbital, thoughts and questions but too tired to speak. Sensory deprivation. Cry. Cry. Cry. Die. Die. Die. Crash.

Wake up. Wake up, Nibir. It's 2058. Humanity's dead. But you're alive. Alive in all of us. Alive in me, alive in Joe's water bottle. Talk to me! Roger, get me an injection! Wake up, Nibir. I am going to inject you with some ideas and philosophical thoughts, are you ready? Roger! Get me Mills and Nietzsche quick. Also Schopenhauer cause what the hell. Roger! Don't forget that guy, what was his name, the weird Czech, the Kaf- something. Yeah, that one. Bring me that. We need to revive this guy.

I almost died. Now I pray to Joe's water bottle.
