The river has a particular sound; when the water crashes with the stones and makes the little pebbles roll. A brown noise helping me to focus more.

I am sitting around trees and nature, a peaceful climate, cloudy and about to rain. I can see the river and the mountains that surrounds it. The river looks really small from here, but in reality it's wide enough to gulp a whole train.

I can see the deep forests on the other side of the river which stay still like sleeping giants. I wonder what is hiding in that. Can I just go away and get lost in it? Away from everything? Let me make amends with animals- because they are far more capable and intelligent than [animals](https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-32).

Perhaps I was wise enough to come here for a change. It's a shame I have to return today- back to the mundane. Back to that prison and to the problems that never seem to leave us.

Right now, I am at Prashaanti Cottages, [Bhalukpong](https://g.co/kgs/35zgYgV). There's a beautiful river and I can see it when I get out of the room (when it's day ofc, now it's night). I am planning to do some writing tomorrow morning, or just nature watching. 

Now, why did I come here?

Well, I am not alone- I came here with Ma. After planning more than 5 trips with friends/family, and seeing that none of them will come to fruition, we decided to come on our own. Even though it's off-season and there's nothing much to see here at this time. Ma came here out of spite, to prove that we can do *anything* by ourselves. That sounds a bit misanthropic, but it is true most of the time. Yet, I continue to believe that you can never be a "self-made" man/woman; you must work *alongside* others.

She managed to convince me to get out of my rot as well. Hmm.. I do experience laziness or friction to just GET OUT. I don't know, but I get pretty "slow" when I have to go out somewhere. But once I gain enough momentum, I can sustain that for long periods of time.

Although there's one thing I realised: trips don't have to be long or even "perfect". You don't really have to go to some popular place. **Sometime you just need a trip just for the sake of it**, to just head out; away from the mundane, society and from stress. 

I think it is a form of escapism. As long as you're not overdoing it (the escaping part), you should just keep travelling, go on trips and LIVE. That's the most important part: **to live**.

This is a cool detour. Short, but enough to *reset* our lives.

[Sometimes you can find meaning in the most meaningless stuff](/blog/p/leftover-dirt). That's called life. It's absurd, yet beautiful.

We did some boating on the river as well, along the sides of the Nameri Forest Reserve.  {.caption}

It was raining *mad*. Still, we went out in the wild river. Letting the current take us, wherever it wants...
