## Backstory
Okay so, I am trying to switch to [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) using the [Tarmak](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1858-learn-colemak-in-steps-with-the-tarmak-layouts/) transitional layouts, and I changed my keyboard layout in both my phone (colemak) and pc (tarmak-1). And a thought came to my mind...

**that this is a great method to turn you productive af!**

Sure, switching to another keyboard layout may improve your productivity, but that's not how this thing works..
## Bruh what do you mean?
Imagine that you're chatting constantly, posting comments on reels like it's your job, and so on. And suddenly you see that you keyboard looks different.

You're unable to type, because **everything is different**.  This introduces a "friction", your brain becomes lazy to type and you get angry when you have to type. And thus, inevitably, reduce your screen time. Yes, that's what I am talking about.

As simple as that. Plus, you don't lose *functionality* per se.
## Loopholes
- "bruh, I can just *learn* the new layout."
	- so maybe one can make a "keyboard key randomizer"? so that people get a random layout every time they try to chat.
- "bruh, I can just use voice notes."
	- yea, and [:you should!](#:xconvo) And prolly you should just call that person.
- "bruh, my brain just finds new ways to get dopamine."
	- i think you should work on your overall focus improvement...

## Future?
Maybe someone's bold enough to try this out *voluntarily* and tell us how it worked out for them.

If you do, don't forget to tag me! (@moisentinel on X)

But tbh, this won't work on it's own, this is just another one of those "productivity techniques". You must work on your overall development, be more mindful and moderate yourself.

P.S: wrote using tarmak-1 layout. i can feel it running in my veins.
### :x convo
**Conversation-Centric Communication**

This philosophy states that conversation is the only thing that counts. Such as phone calls, irl meetings, and video calls. This is because of it's humane nature and attributes.

But other techs such as sms, instant messaging, etc should be used as a supporter, not solely. For example, to arrange a meeting or send some information or location. They should complement humane connection, not take it away.
