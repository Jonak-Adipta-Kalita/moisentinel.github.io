These are the notes/stuff I learned on Michael A. Nielsen's 2019 essay titled "Using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics". [[1](#works-cited)]

---

To see through a piece of mathematics, you must dissect it and familiarise yourself with its individual parts. You must tear it apart and analyse as if you were trying to solve a literal puzzle.

Construct questions, and answer them, from different perspectives and leave pieces blank in questions. The more variation (redundancy) you have, the clearer the proof/theorem/piece of mathematics will be.

Put effort in both specialized and generalised statements. It may be very time-intensive but it is worth it, for it will make you a bit sure about that concept. Things will seem very clear and thorough.

This can be done in Anki to improve the cognitive process and remember the individual & broader concepts for a longer duration. Use Cloze Deletions, Reverses, etc. (cf. [20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation))

There will be a time when the answers will become a part of yourself that then you'll recognise the "truth" of that particular piece of mathematics. 

### Summary
1. Redundancy
2. Looking from Different Angles
3. Anki and Spaced Repetition
4. Truth.
