What is Marcus Aurelius trying to tell? This "parable" is hard to understand, and I can only *assume* what it is saying.

It is saying that nature is ever-changing, but that it is an "isolated" system and nothing changes *inside* it. For nature doesn't do anything outside the norms of *logos*. [Nature is like...]

It might also be saying that existence *per se* doesn't mean anything. [What does the bubble...]. But I believe that it is what you *do* with that existence that matters; the purpose is the work that is to be done, which creates meaning for itself (here I borrow from the Camus).

We could also look at it from another side and analyse the metaphor in human life: we do not gain anything from success or lose anything from failure. It simply doesn't matter, and it is *natural*.

Reflecting on such topics is highly impersonal, subjective and difficult. One can only touch the surface without tiring or experiencing existential dread.
