title: Is This The Land of Opportunities?
---
A wave of pessimistic rage reaches their shores,
Will I find solace if I keep sailing my boats?

I curse the land and its inhabitants
Their bellies full of tar and hearts full of money,
Gluttony, greed and lust,
Mankind defined by their inhumanity.

Let the devil take them
And make deals with me,
I shall sell my soul to set my seas free;
But I wonder if I have the courage,
To suffer being nailed, guiltily.

I am insignificant,
With my own incompetence
And my own ignorance;
For what credential do I claim to be their king?
I am too, trapped in the depths of consciousness
In solitude and uncertainty I cling.

But righteous we are and how I feel,
My crew minimal yet strong, 
Are ready to turn the wheel
Of time, space and reality.

As the wave of pessimistic quietness stills the sand,
I grab the cannons and fire upon their optimistic land.
