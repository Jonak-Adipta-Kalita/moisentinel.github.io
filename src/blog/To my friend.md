To the guy who taught me many things, you've left me with your memories. And I remember everything.

To the guy who was a walking encyclopedia, you always told us the most random and weird facts. We'll never forget that part. And how clever you were...

To the guy who made the most dank jokes ever, you always were a companion to me in that regard. I'll never forget the pranks we made together, and the fun we had. 

To the guy who was a pain in the ass, but really very smart. I remember your passion for physics and mathematics, the way you'd talk to us about them. I implore you, talk to us once more.

To the guy who told us about opportunities, I thought you'd go there too. I can't even think where *I* would've been, if it wasn't for you. But you've left me. I still can't believe it. How could this be? And why? I thought you'd be here, I really did. 

I am sorry. I hope you're in a better place now. We'll remember you, for everything good that you did. 

Rest in Peace, Angaraag.
