title: "Fahrenheit 451: Thin as Paper"
---
I've finally read Fahrenheit 451 after first putting it on my TBR around 2 years ago. And in my honest opinion, this book isn't great. [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13079982-fahrenheit-451) rates it 3.97/5, but at best, I would rate it 2.5/5.

A lot of people hold this book in highest regards, but this book hasn't aged well. The only "wow" factor of this book is the *concept* of a book-less world.

The world built to accommodate the concept is tragic and nascent. The plot is quite mediocre. The characters in the story are thin as paper, with no supposed depth in them.

[:Spoiler Warning](#:xchar-analysis)

This book felt like a subplot in *Brave New World* which focuses on books and books only.

But it was very interesting to see that a lot of the elements of Bradbury's world are similar to this 21st Century world that we live in. [Technology is surely eating us up](https://nibirsan.org/blog/p/modern-era-and-connections/).

Bradbury tried to make the ending as hopeful as possible, and it wasn't that bad, the whole subplot. But it was typical.

In a nutshell, I guess dystopias are not really my thing.

## :x char-analysis 
For example, Captain Beatty's death felt too weird and flimsy. He was supposed to be a major antagonist (apart from the state itself) and he died just like that? 

How about Montag himself?
