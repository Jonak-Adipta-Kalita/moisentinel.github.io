I have been a follower of Stoicism since 2021. It helped me a lot in tough times. And I recently started reading the Enchiridion (Epictetus's *Handbook*^[Epictetus, Robin Hard, and Christopher Gill. _Discourses, Fragments, Handbook_. Oxford World’s Classics. Oxford ; New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2014.]). His lessons feel much more practical and soothing than Marcus Aurelius's (not that they are bad or anything; they are just *different*).

I am deeply affected by:

>**12.2** A drop of oil is spilled, a little wine is stolen; say to yourself, ‘Such is the price at which equanimity is bought; such is the price that one pays for peace of mind.’ For nothing can be acquired at no cost at all.

Here, Epictetus is saying that we have to let go of things for our peace of mind (which is very important if you want to reach *Eudaimonia*). We have to let go of our stolen possessions, petty feuds with people, and so on. This *is* the price to pay for tranquility. 

Another one: 

>**8.** Don’t seek that all that comes about should come about as you wish, but wish that everything that comes about should come about just as it does, and then you’ll have a calm and happy life.

This way, you can learn to live better. Because to achieve tranquility, you must go through both ups and downs in your life. Live a natural life, devoid of superficiality.

**If you seek a happier life, apply the Stoic philosophy in your daily life**.
