[buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)'s [nights&weekends](https://buildspace.so/nw) s5 has been an *experience* for me. It was unlike anything. I've been to academic workshops, science camps and stuff, but nothing came close to this.

This was where you could do shit that you *loved*, build things *passionately* along with 1000s of people. It was a mass hysteria, a phenomenon, but in a good and constructive way.

There were lectures and labs given by the Farza and the team at buildspace. I learned a lot of things from them and from my own experiences over the 6 weeks.

My project was **Explanatory:** teaching math, science, philosophy concepts to high-schoolers via Khan Academy style videos.

And **these are the 6 things I learned in the 6 weeks:**

1. create -> launch -> feedback -> learn -> iterate -> repeat
2. the correct thing for you to do now is **experiment** and see what works out. 
3. show people your work and get feedback. this is the only way you can truly iterate on your work.
4. make it *really* easy for them to understand the stuff you're working on so that they are inclined to check it. also give them the call-to-action (what they should do now)
5. review what's working for you and what isn't. consider numbers, emotions, feedback and so on. and experiment.
6. you don't have to care. just keep making stuff, stay consistent and always iterating.

It has been an honour.
