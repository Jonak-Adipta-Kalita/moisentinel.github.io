I think there's a degree of *win-ness*:

On the top, you have big wins like getting a PhD, or a scholarship, or something like that. High-stakes, massive ROI and several quality of life improvements.

Then you have wins related to long term goals. These show that you're on track, that you're progressing. Stuff like earning a good grade on a mock test, or a subscriber milestone.

The Daily wins (like I post on my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/nibirwins)) show that you *matter*. These give you *momentum* and motivation to keep things going even when it feels slow. They also keep you accountable and present you with an opportunity to reflect on your day.

Lastly, you have smaller, atomic wins. Stuff that you write in your diaries, stuff like "I smiled at a stranger" or "I made a kid laugh." They give life a narrative. It's like small side quests in games. Always makes you feel good, no matter how small.

I think it's really important to have all of these kinds wins, because everything *compounds*. Also, it seems that you *can't* have big wins without having smaller wins. They are foundational.

If you look at the big picture, **everything** is a win - excluding [evil actions](https://nibirsan.org/blog/p/right-and-wrong/) of course. It's only a matter of embracing them rather than obstinately ignoring them because you're a perfectionist. 

So log your wins down. No matter how small. Everything will turn out to be okay in the end.
