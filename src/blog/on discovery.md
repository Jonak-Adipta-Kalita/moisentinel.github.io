### the art

Once you start reading and writing, it all compounds into something much more, something greater. It all piles up to wisdom, to self-discovery and to attain a sense of tranquility and wisdom. Your writings are your life from a bird’s eye view, captured into pages, like the webbed information on the Internet. They are your thoughts, your belongings and you.

### the finding

I feel much “able” and happy when I write, even though I acquired this knack very recently. I believe that, _the discovery of oneself is one of the most important and profound findings that one can have in one's lifetime._ And the craziest thing is that it never stops, and we’re constantly discovering something new about ourselves.

But above all, we should celebrate this sense of change and growth and cultivate a habit of recognizing ourselves.

### the influence

According to Robin Waldun [1],

> _We are what we are because of multiple complex influences, many of whom we are not aware of._ 

When we surround ourselves with the things that we love and are good for our upbringing, we are investing in ourselves. We are making sure a better version of ourselves. That is how we _create_ ideas in us, and those very ideas are our identity, the certitude of our individuality.

Little by little we’ll build ourselves. And soon, after many years, we’ll begin to notice; a profound _change_. A cause of nature and oneself, after which one will try to move past it and do it all over again, without hesitation. **A new perception, a new you and a new world.**
