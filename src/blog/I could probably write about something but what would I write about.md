title: I could probably write about something but what would I write about?
---
I could probably write something,
but what would I write about?
Maybe trees? No, it's a cliche.
Maybe my friends? Well, I don't think so.
Perhaps myself? Pffft! That wouldn't be very nice. 
Then, how about I write about you?

Yes, you!
You, the reader,
The traveler of space and time, 
The dweller of the human body,
The crazy person pretending to be not,
How about I write about you?

Well, why should I not?
You say you're not special,
You say you're just a spot in the ever-expanding universe,
(That you may be)
But that doesn't stop you from reading.
That doesn't stop you from being.
So, how about I write about you, huh?

"What is happening?!", 
And you tell the others of what transpired,
Of the memory and experience put into you,
You scrupulous soul, you chagrin eyes,
That is all the more reason
to write some things about you.

They would surely enjoy a nice story,
Of another enigmatic human, 
Alive and maybe not well,
But doesn't matter.
Because even if I wrote about you, 
What difference would it make?

So I move on to find another.
Topic; and forever.
