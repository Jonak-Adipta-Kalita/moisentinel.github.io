I am tired of turning my head
When I look at you,
In the presence of lingering eyes.

Let's just go, you and me,
To a secluded bubble of our own 
Where I could content myself,
By staring at your glimmering eyes 
And morning smile. 
Without being afraid,
Without control.

That I can be myself
To embrace your warm skin,
Your smooth face and long fingers. 
No mortal being could interrupt;
A singular moment of the singularity that took place next.
