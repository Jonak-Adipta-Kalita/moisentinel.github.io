Here is the list of music I enjoyed recently (in a couple of months). 
Some are new for me, some are not, but they've all given me a feeling of *belonging*, a catharsis.

In no particular order,

- Songs for the Deaf (Album) - Queens of the Stone Age
- Indiscipline - King Crimson
- World of the Void - Kaipa
- Var kommer barnen in - Opeth version
- First Two Albums: Core & Purple - Stone Temple Pilots
- Aerials - System of a Down
- La Villa Strangiato - Rush

There are a lot more, but I fear that they are not on top of my head.
