Making contradictory statements are a piece of cake for me because I am a hypocrite. 

If there had to be a hypocrite LLM, they'd better study *me* for that. I have the best possible dataset for that, since I am the most hypocrite person ever.

Indulging in my hypocrisy, I advice people not to become a hypocrite. Sometimes I do it just for fun, for the ironic "satisfaction".

One question though, how does lying differ from being a hypocrite?

And which one's worse? Hmm. I think being a hypocrite is worse. Aah, I am being a hypocrite again. Should you really believe me?

You don't have to be a hypocrite to be a liar. But you must be a liar to be a hypocrite. Count this as another one of those "hypocrite wisdom".

Why am I a hypocrite, you ask? Because I am confused being. I prefer to remain neutral. Thus, sometimes I am forced to have [two faces](/blog/p/two-face)- be on two sides. This internal conflict allows me to be the best hypocrite ever. 

Now, what if I say that I am not a hypocrite after all, but an illusionist instead? Would you feel better or worse? 

I bet you didn't get a single thing of what's written here. You shouldn't anyway.
