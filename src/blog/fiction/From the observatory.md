The way they move,
Caw Coo, Caw Coo,
Chirping here and there, Caw Coo;
The dimmed bright light, orange and warm,
A streamlined body, swift as a shadow,
Like an exoplanet before a star.

My eyes a telescope, 
My ears a microphone,
Caw Coo, Caw Coo, all black,
In front of the dimming red light.

Jumps up and rustles the leaves,
The shelter, an epicenter, 
The source of the shadow;
Big and haughty, the way they bound,
The light yet dims into a purple sound,
A song, so appealing, finds it's way around.
