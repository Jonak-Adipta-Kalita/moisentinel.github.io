Twenty minutes left for my work day to start.

I spent fifteen minutes deciding if I should make a thermos full of hot coffee or make it iced.

I flipped a coin. 
I said to myself, "If I get a heads, I'll go make some hot coffee."

I got heads. I didn't want hot coffee.

So I went an made myself an iced coffee.

I was 10 minutes late for work, but I am glad that I made the decision without turning myself into a cockroach.
