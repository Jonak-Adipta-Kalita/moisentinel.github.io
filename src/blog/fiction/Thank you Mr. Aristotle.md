"An unexamined life is not a life worth living,"
Said Mr. Aristotle.
I examined mine and found that
Modern schools are not worth attending.

I realised that
School is my oppressor, 
My own Kafkaesque machine;
Its cogs and gears crushing me, 
And every desire I had to learn.

But now it must burn, 
Burn and get consumed in the scorching fire. 
So that I may be reborn,
Calm, curious and autonomous,
In its blazing funeral pyre.

And so I light the match.
