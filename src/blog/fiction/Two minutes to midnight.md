Two minutes to midnight
And I wait for the impending doom.
I see dreams of the future past
Now lost within the
chaos of potentiality.

One minute to midnight
And I am overcome with self-pity.
A contemptuous slow-dance,
A look in the eyes of lost opportunities,
I say, "Love of my life, you've hurt me."

Thirty seconds to midnight
And I try to fight once again.
I turn this moment into a quite rage
Against the unruly rules.
I hear them say, "Give it up! Give it up!"

Ten seconds to midnight
And I swallow the black pill.
Everything is determined,
Extremely malevolent;
To mend the way is now foolish.

Three seconds to midnight
And it's almost over,
Time and space are bending, 
Everything is moving fast
Even I, a slowpoke.

One second to midnight
For one last time, I try to remember,
What was the point of it all?
Clenching my teeth and squinting my eyes,
Bracing myself for the wave to crash into.

Midnight, now,
A blissful impact,
In place of death, there was light!
My every sin, washed.
A new beginning, a new fight.
But I long for the next midnight.

I wrote this poem about a year ago and posted it on my [Substack](https://visionoflife.substack.com/p/two-minutes-to-midnight). I thought I'd repost it here. Maybe because of the nostalgia, or maybe because of the ulterior motive of posting *anything*.
