Once I had an epiphany and then I thought, "I am capable of recognising my deeper self... That, I can BE myself, that I have the choice to know myself."

Probably a long-shot, but I think that *because* I have a *choice* to know myself, I am a free being. I don't know what you might call this, but does seem like another *cogito ergo sum*.

But, am I actually free? 

**Psychologically?** No. Our "reason" is a slave to stimuli. It is biased. This quote comes to mind:

>*"If the content of a screen saver on an irrelevant computer can affect your willingness to help strangers without your being aware of it, how free are you?"*
>-Daniel Kahneman, Thinking Fast and Slow, p. 128. About [Priming Effect](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/priming)

I am not a free-being **in my beliefs** as well.
Because many of those are a result of the knowledge we gained in our ancestral environment over hundreds of millions of years. I think Locke's *tabula rasa* is probably not valid. 

**Physically?** Perhaps not either. As humans, we succumb to bodily  desires and we feel pain *despite* not choosing it.

If we're not free both in our minds and our body, what is left for *us*?

Now, I can't think of anything but to have hope. Yet, I know that hope doesn't bring free-will. Optimism only makes it worse in anticipation.
