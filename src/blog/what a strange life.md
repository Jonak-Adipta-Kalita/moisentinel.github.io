# Some reflections/ food for thought:
1. People are so much less ambitious, they don't want to become someone who contributes to something good, or live a better life. They toil and toil, yet they are unable to succeed. Why? There is a lack of self-awareness, a lack of understanding the world and lack of exposure.
2. System is too conserved. People cannot be either too good or too bad. In special reference to Indian society, the "system" is where the good are punished for being good. They are banished from the system and the hope for change is once again lost [Anand Mishra, IPS].
3. Life's purpose is to contribute to the collective soul. That mean's helping the community, either by creating something, doing something or anything else. Once you do it, people will remember you. And your glorious purpose is fulfilled. In short, change the world.
4. There can be two types of people: the creators and the destructors. The creators contribute to the society, make amazing discoveries, help people. The destructors do the opposite. They hate, they destroy, they slow down growth.
But the question is, can either of them survive without the other?
5. You are like a cantilever. You can only go one direction, and that's towards improvement (one of my teachers used to say that "I can only go up, not down.")
6. Only the people who are crazy enough to proclaim that they can change the world are the only ones that do so (Steve Jobs)
