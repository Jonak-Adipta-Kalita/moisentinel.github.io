Death is superior to life in the following logic:
- We all die at some point; we live to die.
- But we don't die to live (unless it's a metaphorical death.)

But what is the symbol of death? I believe it is an example of a Negative Good (Nagel^[[What does it all mean?](https://practicalphilosophy.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WHAT-DOES-IT-ALL-MEAN.pdf), Nagel, 1987]).

I believe that death is good because all the pain, suffering, regrets go away at an instant. In the end, only a bright light remains (Tolstoy^[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyitch_and_Other_Stor/slqrdxSBIiIC?hl=en&gbpv=0), Tolstoy, 1899]).

If afterlife exists, even better; assuming you will go to heaven. And death is good because it is unbiased, indiscriminate and just. So what differs God from Death? Maybe God (if He exists) IS death. Maybe Satan and God are the same being?

I mean, how am I supposed to know?
