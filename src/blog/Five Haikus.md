Here are 5 completely unrelated haikus that I wrote while I went on a trip to [Bhalukpong](/blog/p/a-short-detour). 

>Silky rainy roads
>And reflections of myself
>Obscured, both of them

> Broken bus stands still-
> Accidents happen like this.
> But I am at home.

> Fast locomotive
> And a beautiful river.
> River always wins

>Dry tree, 
>Skeleton remains
>A nervous system

>Never tired
>Never surrender
>I am a river.

I found haikus to be a neat way to consolidate what you've observed. Those [:moments of insights](https://www.writebetterpoems.com/articles/how-to-write-haiku#:~:text=the%20haiku%20depicts%20a%20moment%20of%20insight) need to be remembered. Plus it doesn't take much time, and you don't have to worry about your readers not getting the real meaning of the haiku. 

This is my first try of course, another one of those pretty journeys.
