I am guilty of a fervent disconnection.
Severed ties to my glowing past
To embrace the lonely present.
I am here, but I am not;
I am in the tangent between the lost and found,
So ludicrous and provocative at times,
The busywork and isolation;
A case of unfulfilled prophecies,
That I made, for my own,
Only to see them fail.
I am discontent of this leitmotif
That the days host in me;
Thoughts of escapism are candle flames
Waiting to be blown.
Indifferent towards the inevitable change
And to never be tired, or surrender,
To accept the evergreen choice
Of being, as a good being,
With humility, without hypocrisy.
And self-compassion.
