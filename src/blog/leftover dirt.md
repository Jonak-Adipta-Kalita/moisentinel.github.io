One lives in an absent void.
The suffering of happiness,
Of life.
Chaos is order
Black is white
There's certainty in uncertainty
One must live to find.

To find, meaning
In a dog's panting,
A fan's whirring,
A tree's rustling,
Is not trivial.

Of passion and pain,
There's life not in vain.
A speck of dirt in the cosmos
Thee shall find thy purpose.

Witness, in the present,
Your brevity
And live your leftover life.
