You shouldn't be surprised if life gives you lemons, or if you find yourself at a tough spot, just lost and dumbfounded.

Did you think that life would be *that* easy? Of course not. There are many things out of your control. You can't really do much about it. It would seem silly if those are the reasons for your frowning. 

You can protest, fight, disobey. But remember that you're not the only one in history who did all that. Those who came before you, have already been through what you call "dread". They too fought, bickered, throbbed. And where are they now? Six feet under, along with everyone else. 

Everyone has the same fate. It's upto you to decide which *path* you want to take towards that destination.

However,

Protest, but with cause.
Fight, but with honesty. 
Disobey, but with justice.

Ground yourself with the truth. That you *can't* have everything under control. But you have the autonomy to accept it. Accept it to live well, and to make the world a better place by focusing on what is important.
